      According to the Encyclopedia of Handball, Romania has a rich handball
      history and has produced many talented players over the years. The country
      has also hosted several major international handball tournaments,
      including the European Men's Handball Championship in
      <strong>1962</strong> and the Women's Handball World Championship in
      <strong>2015</strong> .
    </p>
    <p>
      Romania was a dominant force in handball for many decades, with four gold
      medals at the World Championships. However, since <strong>1990</strong>,
      Romania has failed to win a medal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Romanian Handball Federation, the governing body for handball in
      Romania, was established in <strong>1936</strong> and has since been
      responsible for organising and promoting the sport in the country.
